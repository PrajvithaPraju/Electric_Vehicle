# Electric Vehicle Data Analysis Dashboard
# 📊 Project Overview
  This project focuses on analyzing Electric Vehicle (EV) data to understand trends in adoption, manufacturer performance, CAFV eligibility, and state-wise vehicle distribution.
      The interactive dashboard is created using Tableau, supported by Excel and SQL for data cleaning and preparation.

# 🎯 Objectives
*To analyze the distribution of electric vehicles across different states.
*To identify the most popular manufacturers and models.
*To compare Battery Electric Vehicles (BEV) and Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEV).
*To examine the trend of EV adoption over the years.
*To evaluate CAFV (Clean Alternative Fuel Vehicle) eligibility.

# 🧠 Tools & Technologies Used
*Tableau – For data visualization and dashboard creation.
*Excel – For data cleaning and transformation.
*GitHub – For version control and project hosting.
